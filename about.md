My name is Jun.

I'm currently a senior tax accountant at
[Precision Tax](https://www.precisiontax.com), but learning fullstack
development on the side. By the mercy of God, my wife and I managed to escape
the dark land of Seattle amid the covid debacle and we're currently living in
North Idaho. I'm interested in family-centered household economics,
self-sufficiency, and blockchain development.

If you'd like to discuss household theory, blockchain, or need help your taxes,
you can reach me at <jun@junsunglee.com>.
