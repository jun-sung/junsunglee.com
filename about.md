My name is Jun. 

I graduated with a Bachelors in History from the University of Washington and am currently working as an accountant/tax preparer with a small boutique firm in Seattle. Spreadsheets come naturally to me, so I'm comfortable working in finance, but I'm intrigued by the socio-political, economic, and moral dimensions unleashed by web3/blockchain Finance can be flat, but blockchain is 3D. 

I'm using this platform to document my journey from finance to FinTech.

I've already experienced the good fortune of connecting with a few who are just as excited as I am in imagining the possibilities of a blockchain future. If that sounds like you, I'd love to connect! You can reach me at [jun@junsung.io](jun@junsung.io).
