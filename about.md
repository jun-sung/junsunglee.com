My name is Jun. 

I graduated with a Bachelors in History from the University of Washington, but I'm currently working as an IRS Enrolled Agent with a small boutique firm in Seattle. Spreadsheets come naturally to me, so I'm comfortable working in finance, but I'm intrigued by the socio-political, economic, and moral dimensions unleashed by a new web (web3) built on blockchain. If finance is flat, then decentralized finance (DeFi) is 3D. 

I'm using this platform to document my journey from finance to DeFi; but more importantly, I hope it will encourage those of us out there with liberal arts degrees "taking the road less traveled."

If you'd like me to help you with taxes, represent you before the IRS, or talk blockchain, you can reach me at [jun@junsung.io](jun@junsung.io).
