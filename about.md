My name is Jun. 

I graduated with a Bachelors in History from the University of Washington and am currently working as an accountant/tax preparer with a small boutique firm in Seattle. Spreadsheets come naturally to me, so I'm comfortable working in finance, but I'm intrigued by the socio-political, economic, and moral dimensions unleashed by a new web (web3) built on blockchain. If finance is flat, then decentralized finance (DeFi) is 3D. 

I'm using this platform to document my journey from finance to FinTech, but more importantly, I hope it will help those of us with liberal arts degrees "taking the road less traveled."
