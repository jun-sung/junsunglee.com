A wonderful course that can help amateur coders escape the gravitational pull of "tutorial hell."
The sparse instructions and difficult-yet-attainable milestones is an encouraging work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope ([1 Thessalonians 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%201&version=KJV)).

Things that really gave me a hard time:
- async / await
- testing
- wrapping returned Objects in parentheses
- spread operator
- scope of the arrow function
- toggleable

Recommended Reading:
- _[Learning React (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Modern-Patterns-Developing/dp/1492051721)_ by Alex Banks and Eve Porcello
Despite the noticeably negative reviews on Amazon, I found the book to be an excellent supplement to the fullstackopen curriculum.
