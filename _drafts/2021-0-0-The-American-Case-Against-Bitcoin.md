## Dear Reader

In a [January 2021 talk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-silver-lining-peter-thiel-in-2021/id1527549379?i=1000513763854), Peter Thiel said investing in Bitcoin is the equivalent of following Jim Cramer's 2013 advice -- to bet on FAANG.

In a [March 2021 interview](https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan), Balaji Srinivasan said splitting an investment 50/50 between Bitcoin and Ethereum would be the quick and dirty way of making the most bang for your buck.

Thus spoke the angels.

I originally wrote a short post in the tail-end of July 2021 on why Bitcoin is a bad investment, but after conversationally pursuing the matter further with my friend, [Matt Lind](matthewclind.com), my thoughts distilled on the subject. As an American writing for my fellow countrymen, here's why Bitcoin is a particularly bad investment for us.

## Briefing

Let's survey the field: cryptocurrency is rumored to become or is already becoming the next fiat to replace the dollar. For years, certain strips of paper were, and still are, abracadabra'd to legal tender by the Federal Reserve; thus, it makes some sense to exchange inked plant fiber for a purely digital token. Also, the uncontrolled money-printing released by the dollar's unmooring from the gold standard has borne the exponential hydra of debt, presenting an opportunity for a certain token to rise to the occasion.

I believe George Gilder correctly teaches that **a cryptocurrency must mimic gold's two paradoxical facets to secure fiat status: perpetual supply and constant difficulty of acquisition**. Why? New deposits continue to be discovered and rewarded to fresh generations of seekers, but the ore remains just as difficult to get our grubby mitts on as it was 8,000 years ago. Broadly, the mystery of gold invites success to anyone willing to work for it; Bitcoin fails the test as its total supply is capped at 21 million BTC and, as of writing, roughly 2 million BTC remain (effectively 90% exhausted). Thus, Bitcoin was a purely speculative asset from the beginning; once the final coin is mined, I doubt it'll enjoy as fortunate a legacy as the Beanie Baby.

The horse to support then is Ethereum... but that's for another post.

## Byzantium

The overthrow of the dollar will signal the end of American hegemony, but the blare of crypto hype, speculation, and greed distracts the empire's citizens from clearly discerning such a future and its implications.
