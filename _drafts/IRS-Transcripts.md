# Secure your IRS transcripts

## Dear Reader

While working at [Precision Tax](https://www.precisiontax.com), I've learned things not found in the typical accounting firm. We specialize in clients struck by a [grey swan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grey-swan.asp#:~:text=Grey%20swan%20is%20a%20term,low%20perceived%20likelihood%20of%20happening) event: receiving the dread IRS letter. Every client admits that they didn't think it would happen to them.

PSA: Possessing your IRS transcripts will reduce the likelihood of discovering yourself the proverbial turkey on Thanksgiving.

## Wait, what?

There are two types of cases at my firm: those that get resolved and those that get canned. And the most effective indicator of a case being favorably resolved is the presence of IRS transcripts. The transcripts are records generated for each registered taxpaying entity and are the main reference material used by the IRS on any case.

There are several types of transcripts, but here are the three you should have handy:

#### Account (AT)

Any stimulus payments issued to you will have their amounts listed in the AT. In case you forgot how much you received or you're tempted to lie about not receiving any covid checks when you did, you can check your current year AT.

#### Wage & Income (WT)

Your W-2s and 1099s will show up here. Unless you [primarily reside](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principalresidence.asp) in a [state with no income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/7-states-with-no-income-tax.aspx), you'll also want to keep records of actual tax documents from employers/providers since they'll have state withholding information (taxes already paid to your home state) which could reduce your state tax liability (IRS transcripts only contain information relevant at the federal level).

#### Return (RT)

This is your copy of any tax returns you filed. The IRS currently has a rolling statute of limitations for how long they'll keep your RT on file.


Keep in mind that though the IRS is the standard bureaucratic entity, handling every issue with the finesse of those vibrating concrete pulverizers, it has felled many powerful criminals (Al Capone) when they managed to avoid the clutches of the other arms of US government.
