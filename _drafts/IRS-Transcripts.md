# Secure your IRS transcripts

## Dear Reader

While working at [Precision Tax](https://www.precisiontax.com), I've learned things not found in the typical accounting firm. We specialize in clients struck by a [grey swan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grey-swan.asp#:~:text=Grey%20swan%20is%20a%20term,low%20perceived%20likelihood%20of%20happening) event: receiving the dread IRS letter. Every client admits that they didn't think this would happen to them.

I don't know what you're doing with your taxes, but having your IRS transcripts will reduce the likelihood of discovering yourself the proverbial turkey on Thanksgiving.

## Wait, what?

I've noticed two types of cases at my firm: those that get resolved and those that get canned. As I delved deeper into the financial history and recordkeeping habits of hundreds of clients, a pattern emerged: the likelihood of a case being favorably resolved was greatly aided by the presence of IRS transcripts.

The IRS has tax-related records of you that it regularly references to monitor your account of suspicious activity.

Keep in mind that though the IRS is the standard bureaucratic entity, handling every issue with the finesse of those vibrating concrete pulverizers, it has felled many powerful criminals (Al Capone) when they managed to avoid the clutches of the other arms of US government.
