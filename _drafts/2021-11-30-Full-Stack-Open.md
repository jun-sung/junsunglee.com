## Dear Reader

As a recipient of repeated exhortations to learn at least one programming language throughout the last fifteen years, I have my share of on-and-off regrets with code. Had I stuck with Python from 2007 or Java from 2010 or Ruby from 2013... Well, I hope to say I learned the lesson circa 2021. 

This post chronicles the first milestone of my developer journey after the catalyst of the [2020 ConsenSys bootcamp](https://junsunglee.com/ConsenSys-Blockchain-Developer-Bootcamp/).

Now the main culprit of repeated failed attempts is "tutorial hell":

A wonderful course that can help amateur coders escape the gravitational pull of "tutorial hell."
The sparse instructions and difficult-yet-attainable milestones is an encouraging work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope ([1 Thessalonians 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%201&version=KJV)).

Things that really gave me a hard time:
- async / await
- testing
- wrapping returned Objects in parentheses
- spread operator
- scope of the arrow function
- toggleable

#### Recommended Reading:
- _[Learning React (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Modern-Patterns-Developing/dp/1492051721)_ by Alex Banks and Eve Porcello
Despite the noticeably negative reviews on Amazon, I found the book to be an excellent supplement to the fullstackopen curriculum.
