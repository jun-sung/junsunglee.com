## Dear Reader

On February 12, in the midst of Seattle’s snow storm of the century, USPS heroically delivered the news that I’d become an IRS Enrolled Agent (EA). The road to obtaining this license is psychologically taxing due to having to familiarize oneself with Circular 230 (US Tax Law), which quickly reveals its kinship to the nine-headed hydra of olde. I also believe the EA is not well-known and therefore not well-understood, so I hope the following will help those considering their services as well as encourage those who are preparing for the exams. 


### A byte of backstory

My boss offered to finance my EA license after the 2020 tax season. Unfortunately, his offer came a day or two after I’d enrolled in the [ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp](https://junsung.io/ConsenSys-Blockchain-Developer-Bootcamp/), so studying for the Special Enrollment Exams (SEE) began in tandem with the bootcamp. Fortunately, the IRS was so fantastically backlogged from not working during Covid that all of our clients’ filing extensions (including quarterly payments, audit follow-ups, etc.) had been sitting unopened in their mailroom. We soon learned that the IRS refused to halt their automatated serving of penalties despite their unread mail and our repeated attempts to stop them. Thus, this bureaucratic ineptitude resulted in client after client calling to know why they’d paid all this money to our firm who'd failed to do something as simple and prudent as filing an extension. I noticed an immediate graying in my boss's hair. Normally, I'd be helping him untangle such a crisis, but nay-- only attorneys, CPAs, and EAs are allowed to correspond with the IRS. Hence, my boss not only financed my way to becoming an EA, but even offered to let me study for my exams during work hours if I agreed to attempt all three parts of the SEE within a 3 month window. Needless to say, such an offer is difficult to refuse.


## FAQs

I hope you've gleaned from the aformentioned story that
- An EA is one of three licensed practitioners who may represent a client before the IRS, and that 
- The candidate must past a three-part exam known as the SEE. 
- While attorneys and CPAs are registered to practice within their home state, the EA has *unlimited rights*-- meaning, the EA is the most flexible in fighting the US Tax hydra regardless of locale. 
- Thus, **I believe the EA is advantageous for tax legalities within remote teams and organizations**. 


## SEE Prep Advice

I began studying in September 2020 using [Gleim's EA Review](https://www.gleim.com/enrolled-agent-review/), taking exams 1-3 on Oct 19, Dec 4, and Dec 18 respectively. 

![SEE Results](../images/SEE.png)  

Part1 tests you on Individual returns, Part2 on Business, and Part 3 covers Client Representation & Ethics. Gleim recommends that you set aside 8 weeks each for parts 1 and 2, and 6 weeks for part3; and as the exams can be taken in any order, the Reddit consensus advises taking part3 (considered the easiest), followed by part1 and part2 (the toughest). The idea is to get a small win under your belt, which will motivate you to keep going. Although I agree that part2 is tough, I found part3 equally, if not more stressful due to its insidious trick questions. (Rather than being straightforward in determining whether or not you know your way around Circular 230, the IRS prefers psychological jujitsu.) [Gleim recommends](https://www.gleim.com/enrolled-agent-review/blog/ea-exam-study-schedule-tcja/) taking the SEE in sequential order since each part builds upon each other. Part2 does indeed have many overlapping parts with part1


### Using Gleim

Gleim's readings are so dry, you'll likely procrastinate-- at least as you study for the first exam. As you'll have little intuition as to what the experience will be like, your imagination will run amok, making the first exam the most psychologically difficult to prepare for. (Though you can sign up for a [mock run](https://www.prometric.com/test-takers/search/irs), I can't recommend spending any more time at these testing centers than necessary.) While Gleim is exceedingly bland, their selling point is their large test bank and I think it was ~65% useful.

## CODA

*If you have been having trouble with the tax authorities and you receive an official piece of mail from their agency, your blood pressure will increase or drop precipitously. Your heart will pound, your palms will sweat, and a feeling of intense fear (even doom) will sweep over you.*
