During his [March 2021 interview](https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan), Balaji Srinivasan said splitting an investment 50/50 between Bitcoin and Ethereum would be the quick and dirty way of making the most bang for your buck.

In a [January 2021 talk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-silver-lining-peter-thiel-in-2021/id1527549379?i=1000513763854), Peter Thiel said investing in Bitcoin is the equivalent of following Jim Cramer's 2013 advice and betting on FAANG.

Thus spake the angels… but I object. 

This is your Public Service Announcement to avoid investing in Bitcoin.

Cryptocurrency is rumored to become or is already becoming the next fiat to replace the dollar. For years, certain strips of paper are abracadabra'd into legal currency by federal gold reserves, so it makes some sense to exchange plant fiber and ink for a purely digital token. Moreover, the ever-widening drift of the dollar from the gold standard now presents an opening for said token to rise to the occasion.

I believe George Gilder is right in saying that **a cryptocurrency must mimic gold's two paradoxical facets to secure fiat status: perpetual supply and constant difficulty of acquisition**. Why? New gold deposits continue to be discovered and rewarded to fresh generations of seekers, but gold remains just as difficult to get our grubby mitts on as it was 8,000 years ago. The mystery of gold invites success to anyone willing to work for it.

Whereas, Bitcoin does not. Bitcoin's total supply is capped at 21 million BTC and, as of writing, roughly 2 million BTC remain. Thus, Bitcoin was a purely speculative asset from the beginning. Once supply is exhausted… well, let's just hope you aren't holding BTC til then.
