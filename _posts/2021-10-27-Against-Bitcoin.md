## Dear Reader

Let's review the narrative: For years, certain strips of paper were, and still are, abracadabra'd to legal tender by the Federal Reserve. The dollar's unmooring from the gold standard led to a complete lack of restraint in printing money, birthing the hydra of exponential debt. Then Bitcoin's timely emergence in the wake of the 2007-08 financial collapse and big bank bailouts (re)ignited dreamers and seekers; it seemed sensible -- nay, responsible -- to exchange depreciating plant fiber for a purely digital token.

In [January 2021](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-silver-lining-peter-thiel-in-2021/id1527549379?i=1000513763854), Peter Thiel (PayPal, Facebook, etc.) said investing in Bitcoin is the equivalent of following [Jim Cramer's 2013 advice to bet on FAANG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp).

In [March 2021](https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan), Balaji Srinivasan (Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, etc.) said splitting an investment 50/50 between Bitcoin and Ethereum would be the quick and dirty way of making the most bang for your buck.

Thus spoke the angels, but lest we forget their mortality...

## Bitcoin ≠ Gold Standard

Bitcoin is not [digital gold](https://coinfomania.com/jimmy-song-bitcoin-survival-for-20-years/#:~:text=Bitcoin%20has%20been%20described%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdigital%20gold%E2%80%9D). I believe George Gilder ([_Wealth and Poverty_](https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Poverty-New-Twenty-First-Century/dp/1596988096), [_Life After Google_](https://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Google-Blockchain-Economy/dp/1621575764), etc.) [correctly teaches](https://www.discovery.org/v/blockchain/) that a cryptocurrency must mimic gold's two paradoxical facets to secure fiat status: perpetual supply and constant difficulty of acquisition. Why? New deposits continue to be discovered and reward fresh generations of seekers, but the ore remains just as difficult to get our grubby mitts on as it was 4,000 years ago. The riddle of gold invites success to anyone willing (and lucky) to work for it, but Bitcoin fails both tests.

#### Zero-Sum

Bitcoin transactional currency (BTC) began January 3, 2009 with its total supply capped at 21 million coins. 12 years later, the supply is 90% exhausted (as of writing, roughly 2 million BTC remain) and on trajectory toward 97% exhaustion by 2030. The remaining 3% will be exhausted by 2140 due to the halving of miner rewards every four years. The last halving was May 2020, changing the mining reward from $12.50 to $6.25. With each halving, the cost of mining doubles, and profitability requires more efficient mining and a higher bitcoin price.[1]

#### Byzantine Fault

The [proof-of-work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) method, which awards “miners” for validating transactions and uploading them to the blockchain’s public ledger, adjusts the degree of difficulty based on the speed of blocks to keep the incentive sufficiently high for miners to continue investing in the system. But the adjustments have lead to an exponential increase in required computer power (and electricity bills), limiting competitive mining to those who can leverage industrial power.[2]

#### Orthanc

With miners compensated by seignorage (the coin's market value minus mining costs) and transaction fees upon validation – with the plan to switch to transaction fees as the sole revenues upon the eventual depletion of the coins[2] – what will happen to the system that depends on the existence of such miners for perpetuity? Once the final coin is mined, I doubt it’ll enjoy as fortunate a legacy as the Beanie Baby. Bitcoin was a purely speculative asset from the beginning; The prospect of holding for the "long haul” or as an inflationary hedge is foolish.

Now you may be tempted to place your bets on Ethereum... but that's another post.

## The Fourth Turning

The overthrow of the dollar will undoubtedly signal the end of American hegemony, but the blare of crypto hype, speculation, and greed distracts us from clearly discerning such a future and its implications.[3]

Joel Salatin ([_Food Inc._](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Inc-Michael-Pollan/dp/B002UZ5CHO), Polyface Farm, etc.) shrewdly observed that a dollar saved is actually ~$1.12 due to not paying taxes on a potential purchase. But suppose we invested $1 in BTC a year ago: as of writing, it would be $4.84 today (a cool 383.779% gain). Now adjusting for [USD inflation of 5%](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) ($0.24), [long-term capital gains tax rate of 15%](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409) ($0.58), [transaction fees](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee) ($3.09), [exchange fees](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-much-does-it-cost-buy-cryptocurrency-exchanges/) (variable upon market volatility\*), [ATM fees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_ATM#:~:text=While%20some%20Bitcoin%20ATMs%20are,and%20as%20low%20as%207%25.), etc. We’d be fortunate to get our dollar back!

\* Note: _BTC volatility has not decreased over time. Instead of stabilizing at higher levels of capitalization like fiat currency, BTC's return volatility has compounded._[2]

But perhaps you push back by saying such fees are negligible when moving large amounts of coin: based on [public data](https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/), the distribution of BTC holdings is no different from the distribution of wealth in the United States[2] (aka [BTC “whales”](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-whale.asp#:~:text=A%20bitcoin%20whale%20is%20a,potential%20to%20manipulate%20currency%20valuations.)). Meaning, BTC's ecosystem already reflects the familiar stretch marks of inequity its [founder](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) sought to overcome. Conglomerated with the hydroelectric mining farm monopolies and regular reports of billions poured into BTC by central banks, the fixed-pie of BTC supply leaves "shrimps" at the mercy of the emerging 1% who can manipulate the market to their advantage.

Does your local grocery store accept bitcoin? Does Amazon? Granted, BTC may be used to secure a [mortgage](https://www.coindesk.com/us-mortgage-lender-uwm-plans-to-accept-bitcoin-payments) and/or [Tesla](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/musk-says-tesla-will-accept-bitcoin-payments-again-but-theres-a-catch/), but unless the Fed recognizes it as fiat (spoiler: they won't) and/or BTC is widely adopted for the exchange of goods/services common in daily life, it merely exists as a pseudo-asset taxed for the benefit of the [Servile State](https://www.amazon.com/Servile-State-Hilaire-Belloc/dp/0692282483). Displaying neither qualities of an actual currency or sound investment vehicle, Bitcoin's true value is `null`.

## CODA

_Most of the truly great businesses had no interest in having **anyone** take them over. Consequently, deal-hungry conglomerateurs had to focus on so-so companies that lacked important and durable competitive strengths. That was not a great pond in which to fish._

_Beyond that, as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses, they often found themselves required to pay staggering "control" premiums to snare their quarry. Aspiring conglomerateurs knew the answer to this "overpayment" problem: They simply needed to manufacture a vastly overvalued stock of their own that could be used as "currency" for pricey acquisitions. ("I'll pay you $10,000 for your dog by giving you two of my $5,000 cats.")_

_Often, the tools for fostering the overvaluation of a conglomerate's stock involved promotional techniques and "imaginative" accounting maneuvers that were, at best, deceptive and that sometimes crossed the line into fraud. When these tricks were "successful," the conglomerate pushed ints own stock to, say, 3x its business value in order to offer the target 2x **its** value._

_Investing illusions can continue for a surprisingly long time. Wall Street loves the fees that deal-making generates, and the press loves the stories that colorful promoters provide. At a point, also, the soaring price of a promoted stock can itself become the "proof" that an illusion is reality._

_Eventually, of course, the party ends, and many business "emperors" are found to have no clothes. Financial history is replete with the names of famous conglomerateurs who were initially lionized as business geniuses by journalists, analysts and investment bankers, but whose creations ended up as business junkyards."_
