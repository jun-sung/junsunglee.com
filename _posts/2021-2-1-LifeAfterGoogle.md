title: Life After Google | George Gilder

*What remains scarce when all else is abundant is time.*

So how did I decide that investing my time in blockchain was worth the risk? George Gilder.

### Life After Google

I grew up in Albuquerque, the intersection of America’s worst public schooling and its best mexican food. But even in that wilderness, the advent of FAMGA marked my coming of age as a 90s kid and connected me with the purr of Silicon Valley. Though older now and happily fostering interests in literature, history, psychology, philosophy, religion, law, economics, politics, science, etc., it’s difficult to synthesize these massive disciplines into a single lens through which to understand. So I was delighted to encounter Gilder’s Life After Google, a comprehensive sweep never encountered anyone articulate such a magisterial story as to how we got here and where we’re going.

In his 2018 title Life After Google, Gilder helped me see the signs that our current paradigm of Web 2.0 indeed coming to an end: Google’s freemium empire built on ads, which are actually minuses; the incrementing billions poured into security spending resulting in tens of billions more breaches by hackers; cloud technology regressing into colossal centralized plants reminiscent of the Industrial Revolution’s skeletons now pockmarking the American landscape. Despite the argues that we are gripped in downward spiral, but we need not fear for the decentralizing element inherent in blockchain technology is the emerging key that will end the vicious cycle of keeping data centralized.
 
### Gilder Fellows Seminar
After studying Gilder’s output more seriously, I enjoyed the privilege of joining the Gilder Fellows Seminar in late July 2020. While Gilder and his fellows spoke openly, eloquently, and passionately, on a host of interesting topics, the hour dedicated to blockchain technology and the future of cryptocurrencies was arguably the most anticipated. But when the time came, Gilder became reserved and the whole panel weighed their words carefully, even in the private Q&A sessions after the public lectures. The sense that these men knew something and were hiding it piqued my interest and I transitioned from being a consumer to a collaborator.
