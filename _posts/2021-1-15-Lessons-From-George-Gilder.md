title: Lessons From George Gilder
---

My serious consideration of blockchain technology took root in March 2019 after listening to George Gilder's *[Life After Google: The Fall of Big Data and the Rise of the Blockchain Economy](https://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Google-Blockchain-Economy/dp/1621575764)*. Til that point, my only contact with blockchain was during my 2018 tenure at the Washington Athletic Club where I watched a number of my Filipino coworkers obsessively checking crypto prices, hoping for a quick windfall out of the minimum-wage grind. Though they proselytized me about the coming kingdom, I couldn't grasp how an immutable digital ledger was *the* answer, so I figured these aren't the droids we're looking for. But as I plugged in my headphones and listened to Gilder, he initiated me out of my ignorance; from a layperson's tip-of-the-iceberg understanding to his world of full-immersion as one of tech's most prophetic investors.

### Life After Google

In his book, Gilder helped me identify the signs of our prevailing paradigm of Web 2.0 indeed coming to an end: the critical flaw of Google's freemium business model sustained by ads, which have proved to be minuses; the increasing billions poured into security spending by large companies only leading to tens of billions more breaches of highly sensitive information; cloud technology, the progenitor of Web 2.0, rapidly regressing into massive centralized physical silos reminiscent of the Industrial Revolution's skeletons now pockmarking the American landscape. Gilder argues that we are in the grips of a downward spiral, but we need not fear for the decentralizing element inherent in blockchain technology is the emerging key that will end the vicious cycle of keeping data centralized. 

As a 90s kid, growing up in the midst of the global takeover by the Internet and FAMGA, the tide of the cultural narrative pulls ever brazen focus towards future progress makes the possibility of taking stock of human history and rooting oneself in a narrative other than the relentless forward march of science to be nearly futile. And if one is not scientifically-inclined or succeeded in being an early investor in FAMGA, like myself, then the possibility of such persons significantly contributing to the world feels rather slim. But Gilder's book was my golden ticket into the races.

### Gilder Fellows Seminar

After studying Gilder's output more seriously, I enjoyed the privilege of joining the [Gilder Fellows Seminar](https://www.discovery.org/econ/2020/08/06/gilder-fellows-virtual-seminar/) in late July 2020. While Gilder and his fellows spoke openly, eloquently, and passionately, on a host of interesting topics, the hour dedicated to blockchain technology and the future of cryptocurrencies was arguably the most anticipated. But when the time came, Gilder became reserved and the whole panel weighed their words carefully, even in the private Q&A sessions after the public lectures. The sense that these men knew something and were hiding it piqued my interest and I transitioned from being a consumer to a collaborator.
