title: ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp

*Some thoughts from the trenches of the 2020 cohort...*

I graduated in late December from the 2020 ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Online Bootcamp. The course began in early September and concluded with the final project deadline on November 30 albeit generous extensions granted due to Covid. (As of writing, there are still final projects being submitted and graded.) 

I write the pros and cons of my experience for those considering enrolling in a future cohort:

### Pros
- ***Curation***. News and information in the cryptocosm is incessant, but ConsenSys expertly curates presentations, lessons, articles, and resources into a clear and cogent briefing on the state of blockchain (Ethereum) development. The mentors continued to help us grasp the insider narrative despite the surrounding buzz of Ethereum 2.0 arriving in the middle of our coursework.
  
  Here's the course sequence:
  1. Review of Blockchain Technology
  2. Blockchain Primitives
  3. Ethereum Basics
  4. Traditional and Decentralized application development
  5. Development Frameworks and Environment
  6. Solidity Fundamentals
  7. Writing Smart Contracts
  8. Ethereum and the End User
  9. Smart Contracts, Pitfalls, Testing, and Debugging
  10. Advanced Topics
  11. Additional Topics
  12. Final Project
  
- ***Tech stack workflow***. [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle), [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Infura](https://infura.io/), [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null), [MythX](https://mythx.io/). After several big mergers, the bootcamp not only offers hands-on experience with the best-in-class Ethereum tech stack, but guidance from its core developers. 
- ***The certificate***. [[here's mine](https://courses.consensys.net/certificates/w9trgfa8fa)]

### Cons
- ***Class size***. My cohort ballooned to a size of over 300 students before settling a little over 280. While that nets ConsenSys a breezy $250k, you can imagine the chaos on Slack.

- ***Swindling***. ConsenSys' selling point is to use its clout (["the Microsoft of crypto"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/b45zov/consensys_academys_developer_bootcamp_is_back/ej4mimo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) to back their certificates upon the successful completion of the bootcamp. The fine print recommended at least a year of coding experience with a full tuition refund if you dropout within the first two weeks. The course progresses gradually enough. What they fail to mention until the very end, buried in page 6 the final project grading rubric, is verbatim: 
  > **A note on project difficulty**: Depending on your current web development skill level, this project may be more or less difficult.
  
  [My final project](https://github.com/jun-sung/doge-emporium) ended up being 3% written in Solidity, and 95% in JavaScript, so unless you have a good handle of JS (or know someone who does) the likelihood that you'll pass with ConsenSys' Solidity lessons is astronomically low. To give you an idea of how many were rudely surprised by this: in my cohort of roughly 280 students,  only 42 submitted their project by the deadline, and even fewer actually passed. 
  
- ***Hidden certificate***(?) While conversing with the grader of my final project, I asked if/when I needed to resolve the issues he flagged on my project repo. He replied saying that resolving the issues will enable me to get the ConsenSys certificate of proficiency apart from their certificate of completion. Meaning, there are TWO certificates though this is not mentioned anywhere in the course or in the Slack channel. I received the one for completion, but even after resolving his flagged issues within the week, he has yet to get back to me about earning the second certificate.
