title: ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp

*Some thoughts from the trenches of the 2020 cohort...*

I graduated in late December from the 2020 ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Online Bootcamp. The course began in early September and concluded with the final project deadline on November 30 albeit generous extensions granted due to Covid. (As of writing, there are still final projects being submitted and graded.)

### Pros
- ***Curation***. News and information in the cryptocosm is incessant, but ConsenSys expertly curates presentations, lessons, articles, and resources into a clear and cogent briefing on the state of blockchain (Ethereum) development. The mentors continued to help us grasp the insider narrative despite the surrounding buzz of Ethereum 2.0 arriving in the middle of our coursework.
- ***Tech stack initiation***. After merging with Trufflesuite and Infura, the bootcamp not only offers hands-on experience with the best-in-class Ethereum tech stack, but guidance from its core developers: [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle), [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Infura](https://infura.io/), [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null), [MythX](https://mythx.io/).
- ***The certificate***. Ooh, [shiny](https://courses.consensys.net/certificates/w9trgfa8fa).

### Cons
- ***Swindling***. ConsenSys uses its clout (["the Microsoft of crypto"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/b45zov/consensys_academys_developer_bootcamp_is_back/ej4mimo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) and the offer of a shiny certificate upon successful completion of the course as its selling point. The fine print recommended at least a year of coding experience with a full tuition refund if you dropout within the first two weeks. What they fail to mention until the very end, buried in the grading rubric of the final project, My cohort ballooned to a size of over 300 students at its peak and settled around 280. While that nets ConsenSys an easy $250k, you can imagine the chaos on Slack.
- ***A secret certificate***(?) When asked, the grader of my final project told me that there were *two* certificates: a certificate of completion and a certificate of competence. I earned the prior and he agreed to help me gain the latter, but as of writing he has yet to get back to me.
