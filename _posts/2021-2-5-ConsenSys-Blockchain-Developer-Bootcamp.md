title: ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp

*Some thoughts from the trenches of the 2020 cohort...*

I graduated in late December from the 2020 ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Online Bootcamp. The course began in early September and concluded with the final project deadline on November 30 albeit generous extensions granted due to Covid. (As of writing, there are still final projects being submitted and graded.)

### Pros
- ***Curation***. News and information in the cryptocosm is incessant, but ConsenSys expertly curates presentations, lessons, articles, and resources into a clear and cogent briefing on the state of blockchain (Ethereum) development. The mentors continued to help us grasp the insider narrative despite the surrounding buzz of Ethereum 2.0 arriving in the middle of our coursework.
- ***Tech stack workflow***. After merging with Trufflesuite and Infura, the bootcamp not only offers hands-on experience with the best-in-class Ethereum tech stack, but guidance from its core developers: [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle), [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Infura](https://infura.io/), [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null), [MythX](https://mythx.io/).
- ***The certificate***. Ooh, [shiny](https://courses.consensys.net/certificates/w9trgfa8fa).

### Cons
- ***Swindling***. ConsenSys uses its clout (["the Microsoft of crypto"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/b45zov/consensys_academys_developer_bootcamp_is_back/ej4mimo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) to back their sale of name-brand certificates upon the successful completion of the bootcamp. The fine print recommended at least a year of coding experience with a full tuition refund if you dropout within the first two weeks. What they fail to mention until the very end, buried in page 6 the final project grading rubric, is the following: 
  > **A note on project difficulty**:  Depending on your current web development skill level, this project may be more or less difficult.

  My cohort ballooned to a size of over 300 students at its peak and settled around 280. While that nets ConsenSys an easy $250k, you can imagine the chaos on Slack.
- ***Hidden certificate***(?) While conversing with the grader of my final project, I asked if/when I needed to resolve the issues he flagged on my project repo. He replied saying that resolving the issues will enable me to get the ConsenSys certificate of competence apart from their certificate of completion. Meaning, there are TWO certificates though this is not mentioned anywhere in the course or in the Slack channel. I received the one for completion, but even after resolving his flagged issues within the week, he has yet to get back to me about earning the second certificate.
