Som thoughts from the trenches with the 2020 cohort...

### Pros
- News and information in the cryptocosm is incessant, but **ConsenSys expertly curates presentations, lessons, articles, and resources into a clear and cogent briefing on the state of blockchain (Ethereum) development**. The mentors continued to help us grasp the insider narrative despite the surrounding buzz of Ethereum 2.0 arriving in the middle of our coursework.
- Hands-on experience of the best-in-class Ethereum tech stack: [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle), [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Infura](https://infura.io/), [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null), [MythX](https://mythx.io/).
- Ooh. [Shiny](https://courses.consensys.net/certificates/w9trgfa8fa).

### Cons
- Swindling. ConsenSys uses its clout (["the Microsoft of crypto"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/b45zov/consensys_academys_developer_bootcamp_is_back/ej4mimo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) and the offer of a shiny certificate upon successful completion of the course as its selling point. The fine print recommended at least a year of coding experience with a full tuition refund if you dropout within the first two weeks. What they fail to mention until the very end, buried in the grading rubric of the final project, My cohort ballooned to a size of over 300 students at its peak and settled around 280. While that nets ConsenSys an easy $250k, you can imagine the chaos on Slack.
