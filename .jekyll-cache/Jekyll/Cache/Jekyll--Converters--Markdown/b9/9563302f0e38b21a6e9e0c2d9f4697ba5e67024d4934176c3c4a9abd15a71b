<h2 id="dear-reader">Dear Reader</h2>

<p>While working at <a href="https://www.precisiontax.com">Precision Tax</a>, Iâ€™ve learned lessons not easily found in the typical accounting firm. We specialize in clients struck by a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grey-swan.asp#:~:text=Grey%20swan%20is%20a%20term,low%20perceived%20likelihood%20of%20happening">grey swan</a> event: receiving the dread IRS letter. Every client admits that they didnâ€™t think it would happen to them.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of not filing your taxes every year is that if the IRS picks on you, you have no right to contest their back taxes claim until every return for the past five years is filed. The nightmare is merely beginning as you scramble to find receipts and tax documents spanning half a decade (with no statute of limitations in the case of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-fraud.asp#:~:text=Tax%20fraud%20essentially%20entails%20cheating,number%3B%20and%20not%20reporting%20income">fraud</a>).</p>

<p><strong>PSA: Possessing your IRS transcripts will reduce the likelihood of discovering yourself the proverbial turkey on Thanksgiving.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-transcripts">What transcripts?</h2>

<p>There are two types of cases at my firm - those weâ€™re able to help and those that get canned - and the most effective indicator of a case being favorably resolved is the presence of IRS transcripts. The transcripts are records generated for each registered taxpaying entity and are a primary reference used by the IRS on any case.</p>

<p>There are several types of transcripts, but here are the three you should have handy:</p>

<h4 id="account-at">Account (AT)</h4>

<p>Any stimulus payments issued to you will have their amounts listed in the AT. In case you forgot how much you received or youâ€™re tempted to lie about not receiving any covid checks when you did, you can check your current year AT.</p>

<h4 id="wage--income-wt">Wage &amp; Income (WT)</h4>

<p>Your federal W-2 and 1099 info will show up here. Unless you <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principalresidence.asp">primarily reside</a> in a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/7-states-with-no-income-tax.aspx">state with no income tax</a>, youâ€™ll also want to keep records of actual tax documents from employers/providers since theyâ€™ll have state withholding amounts (taxes already paid to your home state) which could reduce your state tax liability (IRS transcripts only contain information relevant for your federal returns).</p>

<h4 id="return-rt">Return (RT)</h4>

<p>This is your copy of any tax returns you filed. The IRS currently holds copies for the past three tax years, but this rolling statute of limitations means that the oldest available return will be unavailable at the beginning of a new year (as of writing, 2017 RTs are available until Dec 31, 2021). If the IRS hits you for a return outside the three-year window and you donâ€™t have a copy of your return - ironically enough, theyâ€™ll still have information for said year now withheld from you - youâ€™re not going to have a good time. It would be wise to setup a yearly reminder to check if you have their oldest available transcript.</p>

<h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that the IRS is an unelected bureaucratic entity, responding to every issue with disproportional federal force to scare others from breaking the law. Where the other arms of the government may fail, the IRS has steadily felled those with even platinum-grade defense teams (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone#Tax_evasion">Al Capone</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gotti#1992_conviction">John Gotti</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m no proponent of the IRS or other unelected bureaucracies. My primary motive for tax work is to equip clients to be citizens instead of prey. You do not want to be showing up on their radar.</p>
